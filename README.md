## The Story

I touch a substantial amount of links while I'm doing my day-to-day work. After
figuring out that it becomes damn hard to search your bookmarks when your 
bookmark index grows above a couple of megabytes, I decideded to create a
command-line utility that can sift and search through data.

Although there are websites for this purpose, they are slow to resond, and the
are slower to use than a terminal. --- command line FTW!

The data you see here will be my original working set; however you are welcome
to PR and add additional links to it.

NOTES:
I need two sorted texts in sync one for titles and one for links.
Nope; sorting them by links is better and makes indexing way simpler.
