1. Comment out all docker-related variables in your ~/.bash_profile
2. Check the network setting in virtualbox
    Host Only Network:
        IPv4 Address: 192.168.99.1
        IPv4 NetMask: 255.255.255.0
    DHCP Server:
        Server Addr: 192.168.99.3
        Server Mask: 255.255.255.0
        Lower Bound: 192.168.99.100
        Upper Bound: 192.168.99.254
3. If you're still having isues it might be related to some kind of proxy
(Cisco AnyConnect secure mobility client is the most reported one to cause
such issues) try to reboot docker without the proxy and check if it changes
anything.
